# BensBioArchives

Ben's BioArchives is an implementation of transfer learning in space biology by allowing the user to efficiently find the right datasets quickly, using data mining, data pre-processing and a large language learning model. Transfer learning is a promising tool when the scarcity of data limits our ability to train machine learning models. However, in the field of bioinformatics, where data volumes and complexity are increasing exponentially, we need to leverage the most recent data science innovations just to find the relevant data quickly enough.
